If you are using TARS cluster, please refer to pasteur profile.

This is an intent for configuration of nf-core in Maestro cluster on the normal or long qos depending on the ressources required

I am not expert of nf-core so pelase refer to  docs/pasteur.md for installing and running nf-core 

Run the pipeline with `-profile pasteur_maestro`
