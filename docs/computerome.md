# nf-core/configs: Computerome 2.0 Configuration

This is a first attempt at creating a profile for the Computerome 2.0 cluster.

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile computerome`. This will download and launch the [`computerome.config`](../conf/computerome.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the Computerome cluster.

>NB: You will need an account to use the HPC cluster Computerome in order to run the pipeline. If in doubt contact IT.
